* Overview

This module implements basic HTTP authentication against the password file
created with the htpasswd(1) utility.  Three kinds of password hashes are
supported: Apache MD5, crypt(3), and plaintext.

* Example

import basicauth;

sub vcl_recv {
	if (!basicauth.match("/var/www/.htpasswd",
		             req.http.Authorization)) {
		error 401 "Authentication required";
	}
}	

* Installation

In order to compile the package you need to have Varnish source tree.
At least Varnish 3.0.1 is required.  Supposing that the varnish source tree
is available under /usr/src/varnish-3.0.1, run:

  ./configure --with-varnish-source=/usr/src/varnish-3.0.1 --with-vmod-dir

The first option tells configure where Varnish sources reside, the
second one (--with-vmod-dir) instructs it to place created module
files to the standard Varnish module directory.

Once configured, do
  
  make

This will build the module.  After this step you can optionally run
'make test' to test the package.

Finally, do the following command as root:
  
  make install

* Documentation

The manual page vmod_basicauth(3) will be available after successful
install.  To read it without installing the module, run
'man src/vmod_basicauth.3'.
