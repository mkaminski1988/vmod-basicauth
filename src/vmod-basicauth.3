vmod-basicauth \- Basic HTTP authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B import basicauth;

.BI "BOOL basicauth.match(STRING " passfile ", STRING " authstr );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B vmod-basicauth
module implements basic HTTP authentication against the password file
created using the
.BR htpasswd (1)
command.
.PP
Four kinds of password hashes are supported:
Apache MD5 (\fB$apr1$\fR),
.BR crypt (3),
.BR SHA1 ,
and plaintext.

The \fBmatch\fR function returns \fBTRUE\fR or \fBFALSE\fR depending on
whether the authentication succeeds or not.  The \fIpassfile\fR argument
supplies the name of the password file to use.  The \fIauthstr\fR argument
is the authentication string (normally, the value of the
\fBAuthorization\fR HTTP header.
